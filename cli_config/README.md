# cli-config

An opinionated configuration system and argument parser for Python 3

## WIP

This is a pre-release project; to use, clone it, then

```sh
cd cli_config
poetry build
pip install WHEEL_OR_TARGZ_FILE
```

Replace `WHEEL_OR_TARGZ_FILE` with the `.whl` or `.tar.gz` file reported as built by `poetry build`
